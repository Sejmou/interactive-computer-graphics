# Interactive Computer Graphics Web App
In this repository you can find the code for the [website](https://sejmou.github.io/interactive-computer-graphics/) that I created for my [Bachelor's thesis at TU Wien](https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/publications/2021/Kolter_2021/). The website features interactive demos that introduce people interested in Computer Graphics to selected topics, mainly focusing on parametric curves.

## Topics covered in demos
* Introduction to Bézier Curves
* Bézier Curves and Bernstein Polynomials
* B-Spline Curves
* NURBS Curves
* Barycentric coordinates

## Technologies/Tools used
* [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) (core demo features)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) (bundling assets, TypeScript/SCSS preprocessing)
* [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#publishing-sources-for-github-pages-sites) (deployment)
* [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) (rendering math formulas on demo pages)
* [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) (website styles)

I didn't use React/Angular/Vue or any frontend-framework. I regret this decision as the project was probably much more work because of this. But at least I learned a lot about the DOM API and other native browser APIs :)
