# Interactive Computer Graphics Web App
In this repository you can find the code that my web app that I created for my Bachelor's thesis at Vienna University of Technology is based on. I created interactive demos for Bézier curves and their generalizations, B-Splines and NURBS curves. I tried to also show the relationship between the "visual representation" of algorithms such as De Casteljau's algorithm and the actual computing involved.
## Topics covered in demos
* Barycentric coordinates
* Bézier curves
* Relationship between Bézier Curves and Bernstein Polynomials
* B-Spline Curves
* NURBS
